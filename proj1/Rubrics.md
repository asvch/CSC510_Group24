# Project 1 Deliverables

**Part1** (easy): for five prior projects, score them according to the project2 rubic.
Which, in summary, means "does this repo look good (defined before)
To make that more precise, score all five repos as per the project2 rubric
And note that that we will be using that rubric to score your project2 submissions.

**Part2** (hard): for one prior project, a 2 minute YouTube video (with a 2023 date) showing you can run that system
Expectation management:
Probably, your first selected project will NOT run in 2023. So you will try this and that and after much cursing, switch to another project.

**Part3** (important): Write 750 words in a mardown file describing what was hard about this process, how that pain could have been avoided and what practices you are committing to perform in project2 to avoid that pain.


**Rubric Template**
---------------------
|Notes|Scores (0-3)|Evidence|
|-----|---------|---------|
|Video|
|Workload is spread over the whole team |
|Number of commits| 
|Number of commits: by different people| 
|Issues reports: there are **many**|
|Issues are being closed|
|DOI badge: exists| 
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
|Use of version control tools|
|Use of style checkers |
|Use of code formatters. |
|Use of syntax checkers. |
|Use of code coverage | 
|Other automated analysis tools|
|Test cases exist|
|Test cases are routinely executed|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|
|Chat channel: exists|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|Short release cycles |

# Project 1 Deliverables

**Part1** (easy): for five prior projects, score them according to the project2 rubic.
Which, in summary, means "does this repo look good (defined before)
To make that more precise, score all five repos as per the project2 rubric
And note that that we will be using that rubric to score your project2 submissions.

**Part2** (hard): for one prior project, a 2 minute YouTube video (with a 2023 date) showing you can run that system
Expectation management:
Probably, your first selected project will NOT run in 2023. So you will try this and that and after much cursing, switch to another project.

**Part3** (important): Write 750 words in a mardown file describing what was hard about this process, how that pain could have been avoided and what practices you are committing to perform in project2 to avoid that pain.

## PART 3 - Problems faced and promised practices. 
ScheduleBot - a Discord Bot

The GitHub repository of this project has very well-explained steps to run the project in their Readme.md file, along with a short video and multiple gifs explaining the functionality of the bot. As well as excellent use of badges in the repository. Schedule Bot is a discord bot that helps in scheduling someone’s day. In this, we can add, view, and delete events. While we tried to run the project, we encountered a couple of issues. The project required us to create a token for a new bot and place this token in a file within the local repository. The previous group had added a feature where you could add a travel time to your schedule. Basically after creating an event, you have an option of adding in a travel time to your schedule. You add your departure spot and destination and then select the mode of transport. The bot then finds the distance between the two spots and comes up with the travel time based on the transportation mode you selected. For this feature to run we had to set up a google cloud account. This process however not only includes the account setup but we also need to set up payment methods and have to enable the API so that the bot can have access to the location. This is a one-time setup but still turns out to be a hassle considering it is very time-consuming, and has a trivial function when looking at the big picture of the project. Moreover, most people don't prefer giving out their card or payment details just to see if a project is running smoothly or not. Along with this while creating the bot, no clear instructions were provided in the repository regarding which permissions should be assigned to the bot. Basic permissions like Read/View Messages, and Private Messaging someone were the permissions we added as this was the basic requirement of the project, but a detailed list of the necessary permissions would have definitely been helpful. Secondly, once these permissions were added and the bot was added to a server, we ran the program and saw many errors out of which most were pointing to the Python package files namely setup.py and runner.py. Since these errors were pointing to the Python package files, we were not aware at first what the issue could be. We first targeted to resolve the errors in the project files and to do so, we added the intents parameter in the commands.Bot() function. The issues related to project files were resolved after the addition of the above lines of code. After this, we targeted to resolve the Python package file errors. We found out that we also needed to add the Privileged gateway intents on the Applications page in Discord for the bot. Once we added the required Privileged gateway intents, the bot was running fine. Looking at it, the above errors were pretty common and could have been avoided if there were clear instructions for this in the installation steps. Overall the repository had accurate and complete information regarding the project, its installation, and implementation, just mentioning the steps to add Privileged gateway intents in the Application page on Discord would have made this a perfect repository. We would definitely add these in the installation and setup steps in the repository to mitigate the issues faced by future users.

Just like Schedule Bot, we found the repository of the Slash project pretty compelling as well. Slash is a  web framework that allows one to scrape the most popular e-commerce websites to get the best deals on the searched items across multiple e-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, BestBuy, Costco, and eBay. But, we encountered certain issues in setting up the Slash project. One major issue was that the scraper for Target was not working, and we were getting errors. After debugging the issue, we found that the Target Redsky API URL was changed a bit,  also the  GET request made to API needed some modifications in the query params passed and we also passed the header in the request. Post making these changes, Target Scraper started working.   We also found certain other edge case handling issues in the codebase of this project. For example, in file slash_user_interface.py, the variable ‘results’ can receive a value None as well, and we are iterating over it directly without checking for its type, and this results in the error. So, we will implement practices in our implementation of ScheduleBot that take into account the edge cases and make sure the program doesn’t throw any errors.

Until now as students, we have been taught to build projects from scratch but trying to run a project that people had worked on previously was an altogether new experience. The above-mentioned problems were encountered during this process; as a result, we as developers can now put procedures in place so that other programmers working on our project won't encounter them.

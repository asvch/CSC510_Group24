# Project 1 Deliverables

**Part1** (easy): for five prior projects, score them according to the project2 rubic.
Which, in summary, means "does this repo loo good (defined before)
To make that more precise, score all five repos as per the project2 rubric
And note that that we will be using that rubric to score your project2 submissions.

**Part2** (hard): for one prior project, a 2 minute YouTube video (with a 2023 date) showing you can run that system
Expectation management:
Probably, your first selected project will NOT run in 2023. So you will try this and that and after much cursing, switch to another project.

**Part3** (important): Write 750 words in a mardown file describing what was hard about this process, how that pain could have been avoided and what practices you are committing to perform in project2 to avoid that pain.
